4449,"Since no Treg-specific activation marker is known, we tested 97 NS3-derived peptides for their ability to elicit CD25 response (assuming it is a surrogate marker), accompanied by high resolution HLA typing of the patients.",plos_pathogens,complex,5.2,test
4450,Some reactive peptides overlapped with previously described effector T cell epitopes.,plos_pathogens,complex,4.7,test
4451,"Our data offers new insights into HCV immune evasion and tolerance, and highlights the non-self specific nature of Treg during infection.",plos_pathogens,complex,5.0,test
4452,"Hepatitis C virus persistently infects ~ 3% of the world population, leading to life threatening liver diseases and liver failure.",plos_pathogens,simple,4.0,test
4453,"It is not well understood why the human immune system often fails to clear the virus, although it is likely multi-factorial.",plos_pathogens,simple,4.15,test
4454,"It is accepted that effector T cells are critical for clearing infections, but their function can be suppressed by the somewhat elusive regulatory T cells.",plos_pathogens,simple,4.5,test
4455,"Our hypothesis, supported by new data, is that a proportion of the regulatory T cells are specifically stimulated by the virus and that these cells are a stable cell population.",plos_pathogens,simple,4.3,test
4456,"We find evidence that these suppressive cells have a distinct set of genes activated and importantly might have a survival advantage over effector T cells, which helps to explain why natural regulatory T cells may influence the outcome of HCV infection.",plos_pathogens,simple,4.7,test
4457,We propose that the new information provides a better explanation of chronic HCV infection and will let us focus on the key experiments to test the hypothesis and to design better treatments.,plos_pathogens,simple,4.5,test
4458,Subunits of the SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling complex are frequently mutated in human cancers leading to epigenetic dependencies that are therapeutically targetable.,pnas,complex,5.0,test
4459,"The dependency on the polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) and EZH2 represents one such vulnerability in tumors with mutations in the SWI / SNF complex subunit, SNF5; however, whether this vulnerability extends to other SWI / SNF subunit mutations is not well understood.",pnas,complex,5.7,test
4460,"Here we show that a subset of cancers harboring mutations in the SWI / SNF ATPase, SMARCA4, is sensitive to EZH2 inhibition.",pnas,complex,5.65,test
4461,"EZH2 inhibition results in a heterogenous phenotypic response characterized by senescence and / or apoptosis in different models, and also leads to tumor growth inhibition in vivo.",pnas,complex,5.35,test
4462,"Lower expression of the SMARCA2 paralog was associated with cellular sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition in SMARCA4 mutant cancer models, independent of tissue derivation.",pnas,complex,5.2,test
4463,"SMARCA2 is suppressed by PRC2 in sensitive models, and induced SMARCA2 expression can compensate for SMARCA4 and antagonize PRC2 targets.",pnas,complex,4.85,test
4464,"The induction of SMARCA2 in response to EZH2 inhibition is required for apoptosis, but not for growth arrest, through a mechanism involving the derepression of the lysomal protease cathepsin B.",pnas,complex,5.5,test
4465,"Expression of SMARCA2 also delineates EZH2 inhibitor sensitivity for other SWI / SNF complex subunit mutant tumors, including SNF5 and ARID1A mutant cancers.",pnas,complex,5.35,test
4466,Our data support monitoring SMARCA2 expression as a predictive biomarker for EZH2-targeted therapies in the context of SWI / SNF mutant cancers.,pnas,complex,5.0,test
4467,Targeting epigenetic dependencies caused by mutations in chromatin-modifying enzymes represents a novel therapeutic approach in cancer.,pnas,simple,5.0,test
4468,"Notably, cancers harboring mutations in the SNF5 subunit of the SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling complex have been shown to be susceptible to small-molecule inhibitors of the EZH2 histone methyltransferase that are currently in clinical development.",pnas,simple,5.15,test
4469,We demonstrate that EZH2 inhibition can be effective in SMARCA4 mutant cancers that concurrently transcriptionally silence the paralog helicase SMARCA2.,pnas,simple,5.7,test
4470,"SMARCA2 is directly suppressed by EZH2, and SMARCA2 expression levels predict EZH2 inhibitor activity in other SWI / SNF mutant contexts, including ARID1A mutant tumors.",pnas,simple,5.7,test
4471,These data provide insight into the utility of EZH2 inhibitors in SWI / SNF mutant tumors and have important implications regarding predictive diagnostics.,pnas,simple,5.0,test

4473,"Viewing the high-resolution 3D images somewhat simulates the appearance of optical endoscopy, hence the name.",MSD,complex,4.5,test
4474,It has some promise as a screening test for people who are unable or unwilling to undergo endoscopic colonoscopy but is less sensitive and highly interpreter-dependent.,MSD,complex,5.0,test
4475,"It avoids the need for sedation but still requires thorough bowel preparation, and the gas distention may be uncomfortable.",MSD,complex,4.5,test
4476,CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) generates three-dimensional images of the colon by using a special CT scan technique.,MSD,simple,4.35,test
4477,"In this technique, people drink a contrast agent and their colon is inflated with gas from a tube inserted in the rectum.",MSD,simple,4.5,test

4489,Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) immediate early 1 (IE1) protein associates with condensed chromatin of the host cell during mitosis.,elife,complex,5.0,test
4490,"We have determined the structure of the chromatin-tethering domain (CTD) of IE1 bound to the nucleosome core particle, and discovered that the specific interaction between IE1-CTD and the H2A-H2B acidic patch impairs the compaction of higher-order chromatin structure.",elife,complex,5.15,test
4491,Our results suggest that IE1 loosens up the folding of host chromatin during hCMV infections.,elife,complex,5.7,test
4492,"Most of the DNA in a cell is tightly wrapped around groups of proteins called histones, which gives the impression of beads on a string.",elife,simple,4.3,test
4493,"These bead-like structures are called nucleosomes, and interactions between histones in different nucleosomes can link one nucleosome to another, to package the DNA into a very condensed form.",elife,simple,4.7,test
4494,"Viruses sometimes interact with this condensed DNA; for example, a virus called human cytomegalovirus is known to attach to condensed DNA when cells are preparing to divide.",elife,simple,4.8,test
4495,But the consequences of these interactions are not always clear.,elife,simple,3.15,test
4496,"Now, Fang, Chen et al. have worked out the three-dimensional structure of a protein from the cytomegalovirus while it is attached to a nucleosome.",elife,simple,4.8,test
4497,This structure revealed that the viral protein connects to same part of the histones that otherwise helps pull the nucleosomes together.,elife,simple,4.8,test
4498,Further experiments then compared how the cytomegalovirus protein attaches to nucleosomes with the interaction between nucleosomes and a similar protein from a different virus.,elife,simple,5.0,test
4499,"Both viral proteins were seen to interact with the same part of the histone protein, but in different ways.",elife,simple,4.3,test
4500,"Next, Fang, Chen et al. showed that the DNA is more loosely packed when the cytomegalovirus protein is attached to the nucleosomes.",elife,simple,5.0,test
4501,This was not the case for the similar protein from the other virus.,elife,simple,3.8,test
4502,The experiments show that small differences in the ways viral proteins interact with condensed DNA can change their effects on DNA packaging.,elife,simple,4.8,test
